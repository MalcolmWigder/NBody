# N-Body Simulator

A personal learning project: gravitational N-body simulation in C++ and Python. 

See main_barneshut2d and adjust k to have some fun.

## Features
- Implements direct force calculation and Barnes-Hut tree optimization
- Real-time visualization with SFML (C++)
- Capable of simulating and rendering 100,000+ particles
- Focuses on scientific computing, algorithm design, and performance

## Credits
Developed by Malcolm Wigder (2024 â€“ Present)  
All code, algorithms, and visualizations were independently implemented for educational purposes.

## Notes
This project is a work in progress and serves as a platform for experimenting with physics engines and high-performance computing.
